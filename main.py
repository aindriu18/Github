What does a machine learning expert do?

#1 - they will import the data, usually a csv file.
#2 - they clean the data. All columns and rows are filled correctly as sometimes cells and rows are missing data.
#3 - they split the data into a training and test set. Training set is for machine to learn. Test set is to
     tell it if it was right or wrong.
#4 - create a model. Usually they import an algorithm and use a library.
#5 - check the output of the model with test set.
#6 - improve. Most likely it will improve after each iteration
